<h1>Markovski Project üí™</h1>

**Markovski** is a Python-based tool designed to analyze and predict stock price behavior using **Markov Chains**. By modeling stock prices as discrete states (increase, decrease, stable) and applying a probabilistic approach, the system helps estimate future scenarios and identify optimal investment windows.

---

## üß† Project Goals
- Apply the Markov chain model to historical stock market data for five selected companies.
- Construct a transition matrix to simulate state changes over time.
- Estimate the probability of stock price changes after *n* days.
- Determine the company with the highest return on day *n*
